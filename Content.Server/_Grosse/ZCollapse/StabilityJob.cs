/// <summary>
/// Time-sliced wrapper around <see cref="GrosseStabilityFloodFill"/> for one whole Z-column — every grid
/// bridged to every other via a chain of <see cref="GrosseGridStabilitySupportComponent"/>s, computed
/// together in a single pass rather than grid-by-grid. This matters for correctness, not just
/// convenience: if each grid were computed separately and capped its Support seeds against a
/// neighbor grid's *previously stored* result, two Supports facing each other across a boundary can
/// reach a stable mutual fixed point (grid A reads B's old value, B reads A's new value, neither ever
/// decreasing) and hold a whole section aloft with zero Cores anywhere. Doing the whole column as one
/// unified BFS makes that structurally impossible instead: a node can only ever get a value by being
/// reachable, within this one pass, from an actual Core seed.
///
/// Everything this needs is captured as a plain-data snapshot on the main thread before the job is
/// queued (see <see cref="GrosseZCollapseSystem"/>) — <see cref="Process"/> never touches
/// <c>IEntityManager</c> or any system, so it's safe to suspend and resume across many ticks even
/// while the live world keeps changing underneath it.
